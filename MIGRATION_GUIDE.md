# Migration Guide: Monolith to Microservices

This guide explains how to migrate from the existing monolithic LocalShop application to the new microservice architecture.

## Migration Overview

The migration involves breaking down the monolithic application into focused microservices while maintaining functionality and improving scalability.

## Pre-Migration Checklist

### 1. Database Preparation
- [ ] Backup existing database
- [ ] Document current schema
- [ ] Plan data migration strategy
- [ ] Test database connectivity

### 2. Environment Setup
- [ ] Install .NET 8.0 SDK
- [ ] Install Docker Desktop
- [ ] Configure development environment
- [ ] Set up SQL Server (local or containerized)

### 3. Code Analysis
- [ ] Identify business domains
- [ ] Map existing controllers to services
- [ ] Document shared dependencies
- [ ] Plan API versioning strategy

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Set Up New Solution Structure

1. **Create the new solution**:
   ```bash
   dotnet new sln -n LocalShop.Microservices
   ```

2. **Add projects to solution**:
   ```bash
   dotnet sln add LocalShop.Shared/LocalShop.Shared.csproj
   dotnet sln add LocalShop.Shared.Infrastructure/LocalShop.Shared.Infrastructure.csproj
   dotnet sln add LocalShop.AuthService/LocalShop.AuthService.csproj
   dotnet sln add LocalShop.ProductService/LocalShop.ProductService.csproj
   dotnet sln add LocalShop.Gateway/LocalShop.Gateway.csproj
   ```

### Step 2: Data Migration

1. **Create new databases**:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE LocalShopAuthDb;
   CREATE DATABASE LocalShopProductDb;
   ```

2. **Migrate user data** (if needed):
   ```sql
   -- Example migration script
   INSERT INTO LocalShopAuthDb.dbo.Users (Username, PasswordHash, Email, CreatedAt, IsActive)
   SELECT Username, PasswordHash, Email, GETUTCDATE(), 1
   FROM LocalShop.dbo.Users;
   ```

3. **Migrate product data** (if needed):
   ```sql
   -- Example migration script
   INSERT INTO LocalShopProductDb.dbo.Products (Name, Description, Image, Price, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt, IsActive, StockQuantity, Category)
   SELECT Name, Description, Image, Price, GETUTCDATE(), GETUTCDATE(), 1, 0, ''
   FROM LocalShop.dbo.Products;
   ```

### Step 3: Service Deployment

1. **Deploy Auth Service**:
   ```bash
   cd LocalShop.AuthService
   dotnet publish -c Release
   ```

2. **Deploy Product Service**:
   ```bash
   cd LocalShop.ProductService
   dotnet publish -c Release
   ```

3. **Deploy API Gateway**:
   ```bash
   cd LocalShop.Gateway
   dotnet publish -c Release
   ```

### Step 4: Configuration Updates

1. **Update connection strings** in all services
2. **Configure JWT settings** consistently across services
3. **Set up environment variables** for production
4. **Configure logging** and monitoring

### Step 5: Testing

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual service functionality
2. **Integration Tests**: Test service communication
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
4. **Performance Tests**: Verify performance characteristics

## API Changes

### Authentication Endpoints

**Before (Monolith)**:
```
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/register
```

**After (Microservices)**:
```
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/register-admin
GET /api/auth/profile
GET /api/auth/users/{userId}
```

### Product Endpoints

**Before (Monolith)**:
```
GET /api/product/GetProduct
POST /api/product/CreateProduct
```

**After (Microservices)**:
```
GET /api/product
GET /api/product/{id}
POST /api/product
PUT /api/product/{id}
DELETE /api/product/{id}
GET /api/product/category/{category}
GET /api/product/search?q={term}
```

## Breaking Changes

### 1. Authentication
- JWT token format remains the same
- Role-based authorization is enhanced
- New admin-specific endpoints added

### 2. Product Management
- Enhanced CRUD operations
- Added search and category filtering
- Improved error handling and validation

### 3. Response Format
- Consistent API response format across all services
- Enhanced error messages and validation feedback

## Rollback Strategy

### If Migration Fails

1. **Immediate Rollback**:
   - Stop new microservices
   - Restart monolithic application
   - Restore original database if needed

2. **Gradual Rollback**:
   - Route traffic back to monolith
   - Keep microservices running for testing
   - Plan next migration attempt

### Rollback Checklist

- [ ] Stop all microservices
- [ ] Restart monolithic application
- [ ] Verify database integrity
- [ ] Test critical functionality
- [ ] Update DNS/routing if needed

## Post-Migration Tasks

### 1. Monitoring Setup
- Configure application insights
- Set up health checks
- Implement logging aggregation
- Monitor service performance

### 2. Documentation Updates
- Update API documentation
- Create service-specific guides
- Document deployment procedures
- Update troubleshooting guides

### 3. Team Training
- Train developers on microservice patterns
- Update deployment procedures
- Review monitoring and alerting
- Establish incident response procedures

## Performance Considerations

### Before Migration
- Single application instance
- Shared database connections
- Monolithic scaling

### After Migration
- Independent service scaling
- Separate database connections
- Load balancing through gateway
- Potential network latency

### Optimization Strategies
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Use connection pooling
- Optimize database queries
- Consider service mesh for advanced routing

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- JWT tokens remain the same
- Enhanced role-based access control
- Service-to-service authentication

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Implement proper input validation
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Regular security audits

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Service Communication
**Issue**: Services can't communicate
**Solution**: Check network configuration and service URLs

### 2. Database Connectivity
**Issue**: Database connection errors
**Solution**: Verify connection strings and database availability

### 3. JWT Token Issues
**Issue**: Authentication failures
**Solution**: Ensure JWT settings are consistent across services

### 4. CORS Errors
**Issue**: Cross-origin request failures
**Solution**: Check CORS configuration in gateway

## Support and Maintenance

### Ongoing Maintenance
- Regular security updates
- Performance monitoring
- Database maintenance
- Service health checks

### Support Channels
- Technical documentation
- Team training materials
- Incident response procedures
- Escalation paths

## Conclusion

The migration to microservices provides:
- Better scalability and maintainability
- Independent service deployment
- Enhanced security and monitoring
- Improved development velocity

Follow this guide carefully and test thoroughly at each step to ensure a successful migration.
